👋 Hello, I'm Cristian, a software developer passionate about innovation and technology. With proficiency in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including SQL, Qt C++, QML, shell script, Python, Node.js, Svelte, and JavaScript, I have been able to work on diverse and challenging projects throughout my career. In addition, I have experience in handling design tools such as Inkscape, GIMP, Blender, Unity, and implementing solutions based on Linux systems since 1998.

🌱 In recent months, I have been integrating artificial intelligence as a tool, both for managing prompts on existing platforms and implementing deep learning-based solutions from scratch.

💞️ I am committed to creating efficient and scalable solutions that generate a positive impact on the businesses and communities I work with. I am always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and improve my skills in the field of software development.

📫 I love connecting with other professionals, sharing ideas, and learning from their experiences. If you would like to connect, discuss job opportunities, collaborative projects, or simply exchange ideas, please do not hesitate to send me a connection request or a message.
